* Changing the data type of some values within a column.
* Removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
  
## Data Modeling
 From the all the datasets given we have used ReactionTypes, Reactions and Content data sets.
 
 We created a final dataset by merging these three datasets with use of power query and identified the top 5 categories which have higher popularity.
